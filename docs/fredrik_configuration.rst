=============
Configuration
=============

Project configuration is done in ``PROJECTMODULE/settings.py`` and
server-specific configuration that differs between instances of your
site should be done in ``PROJECTMODULE/settings_local.py``.

There's a ``settings_local.py-dist`` template that you can copy over to
start this file.
